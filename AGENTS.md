# Best Practices: Design, Architecture & Development

These are practices (some new, some evergreen) that I consider especially important in this era.

## User Interface & UX
• Embrace the Liquid Glass aesthetic: use translucency, blur, materials, adaptive colors, lighting & shadows appropriately so your app feels "native" on Tahoe 26.
• Respect light & dark modes; ensure that translucent elements, glows, shadows adapt cleanly without readability or contrast issues.
• Responsiveness: Mac apps have varying window sizes, possibly full screen, sidebars, multiple monitors. Design layouts that adapt; test on large / small displays.
• Input modalities: Mouse + keyboard, trackpad gestures, maybe even stylus / touch in future (if hardware supports). Ensure keyboard navigation, focus ring, menu items, drag/drop support are solid.
• Iconography & branding: use the new Icon Composer tool for app icons, check how icons adapt under different rendering modes, tints, specular highlights.

## Performance & Graphics
• Use Metal 4 and the updated graphics/video-effect APIs for demanding rendering or visual work; avoid overdraw, unnecessary compositing.
• Efficient resource usage: keep memory footprint reasonable, manage battery / thermal effects. On Apple Silicon, optimize for low power modes, etc.
• Lazy load UI when possible; defer heavy work to background threads; use Swift Concurrency features (async/await, structured concurrency) to avoid blocking the UI.
• Optimize startup time; minimize resource use at launch.

## Architecture & Code Quality
• Modular design: separate UI, data, business logic. This helps in maintenance, testing, multi-platform reuse.
• Use Swift + SwiftUI where feasible, but be ready to drop into AppKit or custom views when necessary (since not all UI/custom behavior is mature in SwiftUI yet).
• Handle platform differences cleanly: if you plan to support iPadOS ↔ macOS, minimize #if os(...) scatter; design abstractions or use shared modules.
• Maintain backward compatibility: macOS 26 won't be the only OS version your users run. Use @available / version checks, avoid deprecated APIs.

## Security & Privacy
• Privacy-by-design: request permissions only when needed; explain why in UI. Transparent data policy.
• Secure storage: use Keychain, encrypt sensitive data, secure files at rest.
• Notarization & code signing: ensure builds are properly signed; notarize if distributing outside App Store.
• Sandboxing (if using App Store) and adhering to Apple's guidelines for entitlements, permissions.
• Be mindful of third-party libraries/SDKs: their privacy and security implications.

## Core Principles for Menu Bar Apps
• Lightweight & always available → Users expect menu bar apps to be quick to open, use minimal memory, and not clutter the system.
• Instant interaction → Menu should open immediately with no lag; window actions must feel snappy.
• Non-intrusive UI → Avoid modal dialogs or complex flows; keep interaction short and to the point.
• Respect macOS idioms → Use Apple-style icons, keyboard shortcuts, menu bar spacing, and consistent naming (e.g., "Preferences…", "Quit").

## UI/UX Best Practices for Window Management Apps

### Menu Bar Presence
• Use a simple, recognizable icon that hints at layouts/windows (not too noisy in Liquid Glass translucency).
• Offer optional text labels if clarity is needed.
• Adapt to light/dark mode and Liquid Glass transparency (macOS 26 aesthetics).

### Menu Design
• Keep menus short → group options into submenus if needed (e.g., "Layouts → Grid / 2-Column / Custom").
• Provide quick toggles: e.g., "Snap to Left Half" directly in the menu without opening extra UI.
• Consider a secondary floating palette (optional) for power users, but never force it.

### Layouts
• Predefined layouts (halves, thirds, grids) must be one click or one shortcut away.
• Allow custom layouts — but save them behind Preferences, not cluttering the main menu.
• Make it clear what will happen before it happens (preview overlays / highlight zones).

### Keyboard Shortcuts
• Power users will live on shortcuts. Allow configurable hotkeys for each layout.
• Respect macOS conventions — use ⌘⌥ (Command + Option) or ⌃⌥ (Control + Option) combos.
• Provide conflict detection (warn if another app/system shortcut overlaps).

## Technical Best Practices for Window Management Apps

### Window Management APIs
• Use AXUIElement (Accessibility API) for manipulating window positions/sizes.
• Request accessibility permission gracefully, with clear explanation. If permission is missing, show a helpful guide.
• Cache permission state to avoid repeated nags.

### Performance
• Minimize polling — use event listeners where possible.
• Keep menu app memory <50MB idle. Users are sensitive to bloated background apps.
• Test with many windows (20+) across multiple monitors to ensure speed.

### Multi-Monitor Support
• Must handle: different resolutions, scaling (Retina vs non-Retina), and arrangements (vertical, horizontal).
• Allow per-monitor layouts. Example: Grid on external monitor, full-screen split on laptop.

### Persistence
• Remember last used layout, custom configurations, and hotkeys.
• Optionally auto-restore layouts when specific apps launch.

## Integration & System Features

### App Intents (macOS 26)
• Expose layouts as system actions → Spotlight search: type "Snap Safari left" → executes via App Intents.
• Siri / Shortcuts support → let users build workflows like "When I plug in monitor → Apply grid layout."

### Accessibility & Transparency
• Full VoiceOver compatibility (announce menus properly).
• Contrast-safe icons for Liquid Glass style.

### Security & Trust
• Clear, minimal permission requests: only Accessibility API.
• Sandboxed app if targeting App Store (but may require helper for deeper system integration).
• Sign & notarize app for outside distribution.

## Power Features to Differentiate

### AI-Assisted Layouts (Forward-Thinking)
• Detect work patterns → suggest layouts (e.g., "You usually place VSCode + Safari side by side, apply now?").
• Predictive window snapping: offer best guess based on window type.

### Layout Sets / Profiles
• "Coding mode", "Design mode", "Meetings mode" with pre-arranged app positions.
• Hot-switch profiles via menu or shortcut.

### Quick Layout Preview Overlay
• Subtle screen overlay showing zones when triggering a shortcut. Helps with discoverability and precision.
