# Best Practices: Design, Architecture & Development

These are practices (some new, some evergreen) that I consider especially important in this era.

## User Interface & UX
• Embrace the Liquid Glass aesthetic: use translucency, blur, materials, adaptive colors, lighting & shadows appropriately so your app feels "native" on Tahoe 26.
• Respect light & dark modes; ensure that translucent elements, glows, shadows adapt cleanly without readability or contrast issues.
• Responsiveness: Mac apps have varying window sizes, possibly full screen, sidebars, multiple monitors. Design layouts that adapt; test on large / small displays.
• Input modalities: Mouse + keyboard, trackpad gestures, maybe even stylus / touch in future (if hardware supports). Ensure keyboard navigation, focus ring, menu items, drag/drop support are solid.
• Iconography & branding: use the new Icon Composer tool for app icons, check how icons adapt under different rendering modes, tints, specular highlights.

## Performance & Graphics
• Use Metal 4 and the updated graphics/video-effect APIs for demanding rendering or visual work; avoid overdraw, unnecessary compositing.
• Efficient resource usage: keep memory footprint reasonable, manage battery / thermal effects. On Apple Silicon, optimize for low power modes, etc.
• Lazy load UI when possible; defer heavy work to background threads; use Swift Concurrency features (async/await, structured concurrency) to avoid blocking the UI.
• Optimize startup time; minimize resource use at launch.

## Architecture & Code Quality
• Modular design: separate UI, data, business logic. This helps in maintenance, testing, multi-platform reuse.
• Use Swift + SwiftUI where feasible, but be ready to drop into AppKit or custom views when necessary (since not all UI/custom behavior is mature in SwiftUI yet).
• Handle platform differences cleanly: if you plan to support iPadOS ↔ macOS, minimize #if os(...) scatter; design abstractions or use shared modules.
• Maintain backward compatibility: macOS 26 won't be the only OS version your users run. Use @available / version checks, avoid deprecated APIs.

## Security & Privacy
• Privacy-by-design: request permissions only when needed; explain why in UI. Transparent data policy.
• Secure storage: use Keychain, encrypt sensitive data, secure files at rest.
• Notarization & code signing: ensure builds are properly signed; notarize if distributing outside App Store.
• Sandboxing (if using App Store) and adhering to Apple's guidelines for entitlements, permissions.
• Be mindful of third-party libraries/SDKs: their privacy and security implications.
